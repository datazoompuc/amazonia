  <summary>How to develop the Amazon, using natural resources in a sustainable way?</summary>
  <p><br>To answer this question, four renowned Brazilian research organizations have come together to create the most complete action plan for the Amazon to take a leap in human and economic development while preserving its natural resources by 2030. This is the <a href="https://amazonia2030.org.br/" target="_blank">Amazônia 2030</a> project.<br><br>

    Researchers have generated knowledge from empirical studies, analyzes of the academic literature and documentary consultations, as well as from the experiences of forest peoples, businessmen, entrepreneurs and public agents, among other sources. These documents will gather practical recommendations, which may be used by private and public agents.</p>
